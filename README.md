The datasets used in this project are open source and freely available online. The term malware is a contraction of malicious software. Put simply, malware is any piece of software that was written with the intent of doing harm to data, devices or to people. In the past few years, the malware industry has grown very rapidly that, the syndicates invest heavily in technologies to evade traditional protection, forcing the anti-malware groups/communities to build more robust softwares to detect and terminate these attacks. The major part of protecting a computer system from a malware attack is to identify whether a given piece of file/software is a malware.
Microsoft has been very active in building anti-malware products over the years and it runs it’s anti-malware utilities over 150 million computers around the world. This generates tens of millions of daily data points to be analyzed as potential malware.

Steps:

- Exploratory data analysis and data pre-processing.

- Malware prediction using LGBM.

* **Acknowledgement 2:** Memory optimization explanation from [Chris Deotte](https://www.kaggle.com/cdeotte) (Each column in train.csv has 9 million rows. If we declare that column as int16 then we allocate 2 bytes per each row equaling 18 million bytes for that column. Instead, if we declare that column as int8 we allocate 1 byte per each row equaling 9 million bytes).
